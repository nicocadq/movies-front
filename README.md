# Movies

## Features 
- List all the movies 
- Create a movie 
- See a movie by its `id`
- Update a movie by its `id` [WIP]
- Delete a movie by its `id`

## Get started

You must have [the backend](https://github.com/nicocadq/movies-back) of the app running in your `localhost:8000`

```
php artisan serve
```

Also, you should have a MySQL server running with the database needed to make the API works. You will find it in the readme of [this repo](https://github.com/nicocadq/movies)

Now you can run our React App, we decided to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager

```
yarn install // to install the project dependencies
yarn start // to start the project
```

We were playing a little bit with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) as our CSS framework and we really don't know if you will have any trouble with this, but let us know if there are.
